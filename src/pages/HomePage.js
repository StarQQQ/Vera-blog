    Another thing I will always appreciate is your feedback to the blog.  If you have any comments or suggestions I welcome them and would love to hear them.  Always.  Not that all criticism is a fun thing but I think honest criticism given in an honest positive manner is something we can all learn and grow from if we are open to hearing it.  I will always listen to your ideas.  So I do welcome your suggestions for the blog..
