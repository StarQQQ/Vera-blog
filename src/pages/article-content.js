        title: 'Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.',
        author: 'Sheryl Sandberg',
        category: 'Woman Growth',
        content: [
            `Her point, in a nutshell, is that notwithstanding the many gender biases that still operate all over the workplace, excuses and justifications won’t get women anywhere. Instead, believe in yourself, give it your all, “lean in” and “don’t leave before you leave” — which is to say, don’t doubt your ability to combine work and family and thus edge yourself out of plum assignments before you even have a baby. Leaning in can promote a virtuous circle: you assume you can juggle work and family, you step forward, you succeed professionally, and then you’re in a better position to ask for what you need and to make changes that could benefit others.`,
            `No one who reads this book will ever doubt that Sandberg herself has the will to lead, not to mention the requisite commitment, intelligence and ferocious work ethic. Sandberg has been the chief operating officer of Facebook since 2008. At 43, she has already had a storied career: research assistant to Lawrence Summers at the World Bank; management consultant at McKinsey; chief of staff to Summers at the Treasury Department; and six and a half years at Google, where she rose to the post of vice president of global online sales and operations. She has also made it to the top of the notoriously male-dominated world of Silicon Valley, where the paucity of women among the ranks of computer scientists and engineers is still all too visible.`,
            `Sandberg is not just tough, however. She also comes across as compassionate, funny, honest and likable. Indeed, although she refers early on in the book to a study showing that for men success and likability are positively correlated, whereas for women they are inversely correlated, she manages to beat that bum rap. (Who can forget when Barack Obama, in one of his few slips on the 2008 campaign trail, said patronizingly to his chief rival: “You’re likable enough, Hillary”?) Sandberg’s advice to young women to be more ambitious, which can sound like a finger-wagging admonishment when taken out of context, is framed here in more encouraging terms — “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” — addressing the self-doubt that still holds many women back.`,

        content: [
            `The book highlights the clear distinction between the family relationship and the family responsibility. It also goes on to pinpoint the causes and effects of an abnormal family. It is recognized as a thoughtful guide for family relations, a good book for inner growth as well as a guide for harmonious families. Couples are the core of a family; parents are the model for children's psychology, plus love and freedom are the best gifts parents give to children.`,

        `Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java. You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.`,
        `As expected from Head First series , another awesome book that serves as a great intro to the Java programming language. I could say honestly : this is one of the best technical books ever to read as an intro to Java .`,

        title: 'What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!',
        content: [
            `Robert Kiyosaki emphasizes six key points through out the book. These points — which differentiate between his “poor” dad (his real dad) and the “rich” dad that helped him understand business and become wealthy — are:`,

         `1. The rich don’t work for money`,
         `2. The importance of financial literacy`,
        `3. Minding your own business`,
           `4. Taxes and corporations`,
            `5. The rich invent money`,
           `6. The need to work to learn and not to work for money`,
           `                    `,
            `                    Good Points in the Book`,
           ` Flawed Educational System`,
            `As Robert mentions many times in the book, our traditional educational system is flawed. Our education system is designed primarily to create employees and could be a negative influence for an entrepreneur. As Kiyosaki mentions, he's not suggesting that people skip higher education; he's suggesting higher education does not assist with “street smarts.” Financial literacy is something that is rarely discussed in school, and if it is discussed, it is only at basic levels. Based upon my personal background, I've made this a personal focus and will make sure my children are well educated in this subject.
            
            The cost of education continues to increase much faster than the rate of inflation. It's becoming more clear our education system is broken. Robert's statements about this topic are accurate.
            
            Being an Entrepreneur Is Less Risky
            The popular belief is that owning a business is riskier than working for someone else. In my opinion, owning a business gives you all sorts of self-reliance skills you would not get when working for someone else. If anything, with today's “cradle to grave” mentality, we are creating more dependent individuals.
            
            Owning a business has given me much more independence and many more invaluable skills I could still use if I were to work for someone else. On a weekly basis, I now do things I used to consider risky or could never imagine doing before owning a business.`,
            `Complaints About the Book
            There are many reports that Robert's “Rich Dad” does not exist and was made up. This is more than likely true, but there have been many personal finance books that are works of fiction. (The book Wealthy Barber comes to mind.)
            
            The issue some people have with Robert is that he presents his book as a work of non-fiction when it's not, and I agree with this complaint. I find it interesting that John Reed's website puts down Robert's work, but at the same time also sells Reed's own work.
            
            Robert does downplay the role of risk in the investment suggestions. This is somewhat accurate, but he suggests that you should fully understand your investments before diving in. Robert states that investing is risky only if you don't fully understand what you are investing in.`,
